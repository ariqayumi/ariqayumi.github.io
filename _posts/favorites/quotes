Quotes that continue to inspire me:

“Until one is committed there is hesitancy, 
the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness.
Concerning all acts of initiative or creation, 
there is one elementary truth, the ignorance of 
which kills countless ideas and splendid plans; 
that the moment one definitely commits oneself, 
then Providence moves too. All sorts of things 
occur to help one that would otherwise never 
have occurred. A whole stream of events issues 
from the decision, raising in ones's favor all 
manner of incidents and meetings and material 
assistance which no man would have believed 
would have come his [her] way. 

Whatever you think you can do or believe you can do, begin it. 
Action has magic, grace, and power in it.”

― W.H. Murray The Scottish Himalayan Expedition
