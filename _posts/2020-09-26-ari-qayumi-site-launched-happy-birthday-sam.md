Dear Sam,

Happy birthday! 

The year of 2020 began with a whirlwind of ups and downs, was followed by a tsunami of crests and swells, and is now evolving into an intentional journey of purpose, meaning, and groundedness. I am grateful to have you in my life and am excited to continue building shared experiences in the years to come.

Cheers to more years of lessons learned and unknown lands explored.

Ari
